## Python Programming Collection

This repository contains four distinct projects that demonstrate a progression from basic Python scripts to advanced concepts like file handling, data structures, and exception management.


### Project 1: Basic Calculations & Data Management

Focuses on fundamental arithmetic, user input, and formatted output.

    Age Calculator (age_calculator.py): Computes user age based on the current year 2026.

    Temperature Converter (temperature_converter.py): Converts Celsius values to Fahrenheit.

    User Profile Creator (user_profile_creator.py): Generates a profile with height conversion from cm to inches.

    Zakat Calculator (zakat_calculator.py): Calculates 2.5% Zakat wealth tax in Nigerian Naira (₦).

### Project 2: Logic & Interactive Validation

Focuses on control flow, list manipulation, and interactive mechanics.

    Grade Evaluator (grade_evaluator.py): Assigns letter grades and provides praise for high scores.

    Guessing Game (guessing_game.py): An interactive "too high/too low" number game.

    List Operations (list_operations.py): Demonstrates appending, slicing, sorting, and reversing lists.

    Matrix Calculator (matrix_calculator.py): Performs 2×2 matrix addition using multidimensional lists.

    Password Checker (password_checker.py): Validates passwords based on length, casing, and special characters.

### Project 3: Advanced Data Structures & Scope

Explores efficient data management using dictionaries, tuples, and variable lifetime.

    Contact Book (contact_book.py): A menu-driven application using a global dictionary.

    Student Records System (student_records_system.py): Manages student IDs and GPAs using nested dictionaries.

    Immutable Tuples (immutable_tuples.py): Demonstrates how to unpack and store structured, unchangeable data.

    Variable Shadowing (variable_shadowing.py): Visualizes the difference between local and global scopes.

    Calculator (calculator.py): A robust tool with built-in error handling for division by zero.

### Project 4: File Handling & String Analysis

Focuses on external file interaction, persistence, and robust error catching.

    CSV Parser (csv_parser.py): Parses product data and displays an aligned inventory table.

    Diary/Note App (note_app.py): A persistent storage app that appends notes with timestamps.

    Division Calculator (division_calculator.py): Uses try-except-else-finally blocks for safe execution.

    String Analyzer (string_reverser_analyzer.py): Counts vowels/consonants and checks for palindromes.

    Math Game (math_game.py): Features advanced hints using the math and random modules.

#### 🚀 Execution Instructions
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed.

    For csv_parser.py, a products.csv file must be in the same folder with the format: Product,Price,Quantity.

Running the Scripts

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the specific project directory using the cd command.

    Run any script by typing:
    Bash

    python filename.py
